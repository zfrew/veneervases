# Veneer Vases

## Parts

* Lasercut Base DXF
  * Lasercut Quantity 1 out of 1/4" Acrylic Stock. Attach to PVC pipe using PVC cement. 
* Wood Veneer DXF
  * Compatible with any wood under 1/4". Anything thicker will be difficult to bend. Lasercut such that cut lines go through at least 80% of the depth. Inadequate cut depth will limit the wood's ability to bend. Make sure to seal woods prone to rotting after the wood is bonded to the PVC. Sealed wood will not bond to PVC as well as unsealed. 
* Vase Stand STL 
  * 3D Print. I used an SLA machine and a matte black paint to achieve the surface finish I wanted
* PVC pipe
  * Use 8" Schedule 40 PVC pipe cut to a length of 161.93mm. Keep a negative tolerance in mind when making your cut (i.e better for the pipe to be too short than too long). Using a cut off tool on a lathe is the best way to do this. A saw will work, but keep in mind that an angled cut will result in an angled vase. 

## Assembly

1. Attach the Lasercut Base to the PVC pipe using PVC cement. 
2. Use epoxy to bond the wood to the PVC. I used 3M DP420 which is a good general purpose choice. When selecting an epoxy, look for keywords like rigid, high peel strength, and low surface energy. If you want to have an easier time than I did, apply the epoxy uniformly to the wood veneer, and wrap it around the PVC pipe using hose clamps. Rubber bands will work for this, but you will need a lot of them and hose clamps tend to be much easier to work with. [Mcmaster Carr #5415K43](https://www.mcmaster.com/5415K43/) will work well. Watch out for the veneer creeping upwards on the PVC pipe while the epoxy dries. It's worth using C clamps or a heavy weight to constrain the veneer in Z on the PVC pipe while the epoxy dries. 
3. Use epoxy to secure the Vase Stand to the Lasercut Base. If your epoxy worked in Step 2, it will also work here. Getting the Vase Stand centered can be tricky. I used calipers to measure the offset between the outside of the veneer and the top edge of the vase stand. Go around the vase until you get a consistent offset around the entire perimeter. 
4. Plant your plants! Either water your plants somewhere where water drainage is a non-issue, or get a container for water to drip into. [I really like these glass bowls on etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/243440211/set-of-six-fused-glasssmallbowlssoyga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=glass+soy&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&organic_search_click=1&frs=1&bes=1), but they're a bit on the small side.
